# Speech Recognition

Speech recognition (ASR) converts what the user says in real time into text. It is suitable for scenarios such as voice input, voice commands, and conversational interactions.

In AIUI, speech recognition is usually the first step in the voice interaction pipeline: first recognize what the user said, then pass the text to your business logic or a large language model for processing.

## Use Cases

- Voice input fields
- Voice Q&A
- Voice control commands
- Interaction flows that need to listen and process at the same time

## Basic Usage

Create a recognition instance with `SpeechRecognition`:

```javascript
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
recognition.lang = 'pt-BR'; // BCP 47 tag. Leave empty to use the host default.

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const best = event.results[0][0];
  console.log('识别结果:', best.transcript);
  console.log('置信度:', best.confidence);
};

recognition.onerror = (event) => {
  console.error('识别错误:', event.error, event.message);
};

recognition.start();
```

## Common Methods

- **`start()`**: Starts one recognition session.
- **`stop()`**: Requests to end recognition and produce the final result.
- **`abort()`**: Immediately aborts recognition.

## Best Practices

- Before starting recognition, make sure the UI is in an interactive state.
- Clearly show states such as "listening", "recognizing", and "completed" to the user.
- Set `recognition.lang` to a BCP 47 tag such as `pt-BR` when the agent must listen in a specific language.
