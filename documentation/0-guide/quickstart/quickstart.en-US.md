# Quick Start

## I. Initialize an AIUI Project

1.Run the following commands in the device terminal

```
npm create @yodaos-pkg/aiui-agent@latest my-agent
```

![image.png](../../image/quickstart.en-us/image.png)

```
cd my-agent # Navigate to the folder named my-agent
ls # List the files and subfolders in the current folder
```

2.Project file location

## II. Import an AIUI Project Using Craft Global (AIUI Web IDE)

1.Open Craft Global (AIUI Web IDE): [https://js.rokid.com/craft?region=global](https://js.rokid.com/craft?region=global)

![image.png](../../image/quickstart.en-us/image%203.png)

2.Import an AIUI project from a local folder, a local .aix file, or a GitHub subdirectory. Craft treats everything after `/tree/` as one git ref, so a URL like `/tree/main/samples/pt-br` fails. For the pt-BR glasses agent, paste `https://github.com/pedrobastosribeiro/Rokid_AIUI/tree/pt-br` instead.

## III. Debug in Craft Web

1.Click Run Agent to debug the project in the browser

2.The Web IDE can simulate the entire process, from wake-up and speech recognition through large language model processing and voice output

3.The controls on the right simulate the glasses' Back, Tap, and forward/backward swipe actions

## IV. Develop with AIUI Coding Agent in Craft

1.Craft provides an LLM (DeepSeek V4 Pro) free of charge by default. You can download Skills to assist with development; remember to enable them after downloading

2.You can also use your own model for development

![image.png](../../image/quickstart.en-us/image%208.png)

3.Use Vibe Coding on the main AIUI Code page

## V. Package and Upload the AIUI Project from Craft to AIUI Studio

1.AIUI Studio (Global): [https://aiui-global.rokid.com/](https://aiui-global.rokid.com/)

2.Create an AIUI Agent in AIUI Studio

3.A newly created AIUI Agent is not yet bound to an AIUI project. It is normal for a load failure message to appear; close it, then bind the project

![image.png](../../image/quickstart.en-us/image%2011.png)

4.Choose one of the following methods to bind the AIUI project to the corresponding AIUI Agent

Method 1: After closing the message, upload the AIUI project directly to bind it

![image.png](../../image/quickstart.en-us/image%204.png)

Method 2: Go to Editor Settings > Local Management, then bind the corresponding AIUI Agent

![image.png](../../image/quickstart.en-us/image%2012.png)

5.Package the AIUI project and upload it to AIUI Studio

![image.png](../../image/quickstart.en-us/image%2014.png)

6.Configure the required permissions for the AIUI project. You can enter a description of the AIUI Agent on the right

## VI. Debug on the Glasses

<aside>

Warning: Before you can debug the AIUI project on the physical glasses, it must be bound to an AIUI Agent, packaged, and uploaded.

</aside>

1.On the glasses, go to Settings > Developer > AIUI > Update Glasses Resource Package

3.When the download is complete, the icon disappears and a toast message appears

![image.png](../../image/quickstart.en-us/image%2017.png)

4.Wake the AI assistant and say the name of the corresponding AIUI Agent to launch it for debugging
