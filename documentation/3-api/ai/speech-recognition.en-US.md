# Speech Recognition

Speech recognition converts what the user says in real time into text. It is suitable for voice input, voice commands, hands-free input, and conversational interaction.

In AIUI, speech recognition is usually the first step in a voice interaction pipeline: user speech is recognized into text first, and then the text is passed to business logic or a large language model for further processing.

## Use Cases

- Voice input fields
- Voice Q&A
- Voice control commands
- Interaction flows that need to listen and process at the same time

## Entry Point

Speech recognition is based on `SpeechRecognition`:

```javascript
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const best = event.results[0][0];
  console.log(best.transcript, best.confidence);
};

recognition.onerror = (event) => {
  console.error(event.error, event.message);
};

recognition.start();
```

## Common Methods

### `start()`
- Starts a recognition session.

### `stop()`
- Requests the current recognition session to end and produce a final result if possible.

### `abort()`
- Immediately aborts the current recognition session without waiting for a normal final result.

## Event Handling Recommendations

- Use `onresult` to receive recognition results.
- Use `onerror` to handle exceptions such as permission issues, device problems, or recognition failures.
- Use `onend` to know when the current recognition session has ended and update the UI state in time.

## Recommendations

- Before starting recognition, make sure the current screen is ready for interaction.
- Clearly present states such as "listening", "recognizing", "recognition complete", and "recognition failed" to users.
- Do not start multiple recognition sessions concurrently on the same instance.
- Set `recognition.lang` to a BCP 47 tag such as `pt-BR` when the agent must listen in a specific language.
